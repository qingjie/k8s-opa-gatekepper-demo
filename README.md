# k8s-opa-gatekepper-demo


This project is demoing OPA Gatekeeper with Kubernetes. Gatekeeper is an opensource project supported by CNCF. It aims for creating policies to manage Kubernetes like:
* Enforcing labels on namespaces
* Allowing only images coming from certain Docker Registries
* Require all Pods specify resource requests and limits
* Prevent conflicting Ingress objects from being created.
* Enforcing running containers as non-root.
